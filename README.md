# kollekt.io

An app to allow some people to post questions and share them so that other people can post answers.

Here are some [Mockups](https://moqups.com/espy/6Z09A8MQ/p:a2dbdec6d).

Start with `$ grunt server`

## Installation

Clone, `$ npm install`, then run the server with `$ grunt server`, then in another tab `$ bower install`. This is because bower uses the `hoodie.js`-file that is dynamically created by the server.
